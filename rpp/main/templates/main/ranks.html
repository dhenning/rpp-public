                    <p class="container">The vision of RaidingPartyPlus is to actively be of service to its members and the Twitch community as pillar of acceptance, inspiration, and support. We will strive together to build a society that every member, whether streamer or fan, can call home. To accomplish this endeavour, it is agreed upon that every person whether a new recruit or a practiced veteran, continually seek out new ways to aid their fellow constituents. That which a single person aims for becomes that which the group seeks out to complete.
